# Iris Flower Data Set - A Summary - Author: Killian Foley

## Introduction
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*. It is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula “all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus”.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris Flower (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)

## The Data Set
The data set consists of a set of 150 records under 5 attributes — Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width and Species-Labels. The data set was downloaded from the following link [Iris dataset.csv](https://tableconvert.com/?output=csv)
